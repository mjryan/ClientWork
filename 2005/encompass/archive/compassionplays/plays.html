				<strong>KICK:</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				Tradition or travesty? KICK explores racial stereotyping and the American Indian mascot 
				issue through the eyes of Grace Greene, one of the few Native American students at Newman 
				High School. When Grace decides to take a stand against her school's &quot;brave&quot; 
				mascot, she learns that sometimes sports are far more than just fun and games.
				<br />
				<br />
				KICK tells the story of a week in the life of Grace Greene. It's a big 
				week—Homecoming Week—when tradition and school spirit become fighting words. An 
				incident of vandalism to her school's beloved logo—the Newman Brave—begins a 
				chain of events that change Grace, her family and her community.
				<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Some voices from KICK:</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				GRACE:<br />
				The eagle feather is a sacred object. Imagine how it feels to have it 
				printed on notepads, and water bottles and pencil sharpeners. Imagine how 
				it would feel to have a crucifix, or the Star of David painted on the gymnasium floor.
				<br />
				<br />
				KEVIN, captain of the Newman Braves football team:<br />
				Is there a limit to this &quot;political correctness&quot;?  I mean, if we 
				change our name to the Bears, will the animal rights people be upset?
				<br />
				<br />
				JENNIFER, Grace's younger sister:<br />
				Some people just don't get it, Grace. I know who I am. I just want to, 
				like, go to school, you know?
				<br />
				<br />
				DORIS GREENE, Grace's mother:<br />
				Now I've got no problem with turkey handprints or a Play-Do Plymouth Rock. 
				But what's the harm in telling the truth about Thanksgiving?
				<br />
				<br />
				VANESSA, Grace's teammate:<br />
				No offense, Grace, but I don't get it. I mean, all my grandparents were born 
				in Mexico—you know that. And I'm not offended by the Aztecs over in Eastridge.
				<br />
				<br />
				MRS. LOEWEN, Grace's principal:<br />
				I'd really like to continue this conversation, Grace. We don't have a 
				Native American Awareness club, do we? What would you think of starting one?
				<br />
				<br />
				CAROLYN CHANG, local television news reporter:<br />
				I've seen it get ugly at other schools, Grace. I've seen families leave town.
				<br />
				<br />
				COACH:<br />
				Grace, I want you to know I'm behind you on this mascot thing. I might 
				not speak up about it. I mean, they expect a coach to have school spirit, 
				you know?
				</p>

				<strong>HORIZON LINE:</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				What are the seeds of prejudice? HORIZON LINE explores bias-motivated behavior 
				through the eyes of Danny Curtis&mdash;a young white man on a path of escalating 
				destruction&mdash;and the people in his life who influence his choices, for better 
				and for worse.
				<br />
				<br />
				HORIZON LINE tells a story of conflicting impulses and loyalties in the life of 
				an impressionable young man. Danny loves art and yearns to create a happy picture 
				of himself and his world. But his desire to fit in&mdash;to be seen, to be heard&mdash;lead 
				him toward acts that destroy property, frighten people and place his own future 
				in jeopardy.
				<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Some voices from HORIZON LINE:</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				DANNY:<br />
				Just because you're young, and male, and white doesn't make everybody's bad day is your fault.
				<br />
				<br />
				DANNY'S MOM:<br />
				I don't know where my kids get some of their attitudes. I will not tolerate prejudice of 
				any kind in my house. Even jokes.
				<br />
				<br />
				MR. CARTER, Danny's history teacher:<br />
				OK Danny, if you're such an artist and you're so fascinated with swastikas, 
				at least you should know something about them. It's a very ancient symbol. Hitler 
				just stole it.
				<br />
				<br />
				JD, Danny's sister's boyfriend:<br />
				They're putting people in jail for words now. Next thing, they'll be telling you what to think.
				<br />
				<br />
				DANNY'S DAD:<br />
				So your mother calls me, wakes me up—&quot;Come and get your son.&quot;  When you screw up, 
				you're my son.
				<br />
				<br />
				ERNESTO, a graffiti removal specialist:<br />
				This is not just about skinheads. I know that. Some of the worst stuff is between 
				us—black, brown, Korean, Armenian, immigrant, non-immigrant—whoever.
				<br />
				<br />
				AARON, a Jewish high school student:<br />
				I'm standing at the sink. I look up, and I notice the mirror next to me. There's 
				something scratched in the mirror. A swastika. Deep scratches.
				<br />
				<br />
				WALTER, a fellow artist:<br />
				We all kinda want the same things, Danny. And not just on some holiday, some 
				racial pride month or cultural awareness week.  All the time.

				<strong>WHEELS:</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				Who &quot;belongs&quot; in this country and who doesn't?  WHEELS explores 
				immigration, xenophobia and the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship 
				through the eyes of Oscar, a 15 ½ year old Salvadoran-American youth and the 
				people he encounters on his first journey through the maze of the DMV.
				<br />
				<br />
				Oscar is a young man on the move. WHEELS tells the story of Oscar's first 
				steps toward independence, as he steps off the bus and into the Department 
				of Motor Vehicles. In pursuit of his learner's permit and ultimately his 
				driver's license, Oscar encounters a range of perspectives on freedom, mobility, 
				and the dreams and realities associated with U.S. citizenship.
				<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Some voices from WHEELS:</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				OSCAR:<br />
				I'm not a bus person.  I'm a car person.  I want to drive.
				<br />
				<br />
				MS LIBERTY, a DMV employee:<br />
				Now this country still has the most generous immigration policy in the world. 
				But things have gotten more...complicated. Gotta show your paperwork now. That's the rule.
				<br />
				<br />
				MR. SINGH, another DMV employee:<br />
				We have immigration laws in this country.  Why have laws if you don't enforce them?
				<br />
				<br />
				LISA, a girl waiting in line:<br />
				My parents moved here from Beijing. They moved for us, they say.
				<br />
				<br />
				LUIS, Oscar's friend:<br />
				Everybody's suspicious. Everybody thinks you're a criminal. We didn't 
				come here to abuse the system. We came here to live. I just want to drive.
				<br />
				<br />
				MR. DOUGLAS., a man waiting in line:<br />
				Sure I have to ask for immigration papers, but it's the law. Hire illegals and who pays?  Me.
				<br />
				<br />
				MS. TURNER, the road test examiner:<br />
				Sweetie I've seen it all. People from all over the world, trying to drive on 
				American roads. Lord, every time I get in the car, it's another country.
