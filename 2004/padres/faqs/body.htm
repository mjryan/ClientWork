			<a name="secure"><strong>Is this a secure site? Is it safe to order online?</strong></a><br>
			Yes. Ordering through our site is absolutely safe. Our fulfillment company uses 128-bit encryption to
			ensure that your personal information is kept private for purposes of this order only. An ICSA certified
			firewall appliance is used to guarantee security. This firewall blocks traffic to unused ports in order to
			prevent unauthorized access. All traffic is logged and we continually update our servers with the latest
			service security updates. Additionally, credit card numbers are not stored. A transaction code received
			from the credit card company is retained for order identification.

		<p>
			<a name="shippingaddress"><strong>Can I send books to more than one address?</strong></a><br>

			Once you complete your order and click the &quot;Submit Order&quot; button you will receive a confirmation
			page with your order number. This is your order receipt and verification.
		</p>

		<p>
			<a name="cardstatement"><strong>What name will appear on my credit card statement for this order?</strong></a><br>
			Apple Graphics is the fulfillment company that is providing us with the E-commerce functionality
			and therefore will be the name that appears on your credit card statement.
