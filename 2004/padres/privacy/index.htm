			<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
			www.petcoparkbook.com (&quot;Site,&quot; &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) is the official website for The Sweet Spot.
			This Site is owned and operated by Canum Entertainment LLC (&quot;Canum&quot;).
		</p>
		<p>
			Your privacy is very important to us. Because we gather certain types of personally identifiable
			information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) from users of our website, we feel you should know
			how we use the Personal Information that you may voluntarily provide us and the Personal Information
			that is collected passively through the use of cookies or image tags. The Privacy Policy is a part
			of the Site&#8217;s Terms of Use Agreement, which is binding on all users.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unless specified otherwise on the Site, users must be at least 18 years of age and a legal resident of
			the United States before participation in any activity that requires the submission of Personal Information.
			By your participation in our Site activities, you certify that you are at least eighteen years of age. All
			users of the Site are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when
			prompted, and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false or fraudulent.
			In the event that certain areas of the Site are identified as being intended for children, the
			&quot;Children&#8217;s Privacy Guidelines&quot; set forth below shall apply to such areas.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong>Consent to Terms of Privacy Policy</strong><br>
			If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Site&#8217;s activities
			or services that require you to provide your Personal Information.  Your continued participation
			indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, maintenance,
			management and storage of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy
			Policy will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong>Children&#8217;s Privacy Guidelines</strong><br>
			We are committed to complying fully with the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. This Site is
			not directed to or intended for children under the age of thirteen, except for those certain areas of the Site
			that we may have identified as intended for children under thirteen. If you are under thirteen years of age,
			please do not use any area of the Site that we have not identified as intended for you. We do not knowingly
			collect any personally identifiable information from children under thirteen from any area of the Site that we
			have not specifically identified as intended for children under thirteen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Generally, if we have identified an area of the Site as intended for children under age thirteen, we will limit our
			collection of information from that area to nonpersonally identifiable information.  For instance, in certain areas
			of the Site we may ask for age or birthdate information in order to help verify the age of Site visitors. From time
			to time, we may also request limited personally identifiable information (e.g., children&#8217;s email addresses) in order
			to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities. In those cases, parents may review a
			privacy notice on the relevant area of the Site that describes our policies and practices governing the collection,
			use and disclosure of any personally identifiable information. In addition, parents will typically have the opportunity
			to consent to the collection and use of their child&#8217;s personally identifiable information. In no event will
			we condition a child&#8217;s participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more personally identifiable
			information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
		</p>
		<p>
			You hereby agree that all information you provide through the Site, including but not limited to information regarding
			age verification, shall be truthful, accurate, and complete. If you are a parent of a child under the age of thirteen
			and you have questions about our Site or Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact our Privacy Coordinator
			at <a href="mailto:legal@canum.com">legal@canum.com</a>.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</strong><br>
			Generally, you may browse this Site without providing any Personal Information. The Personal Information you voluntarily provide
			may include your first and last name, and email address. Your Personal Information will be used to provide you with more information
			and ordering opportunities for The Sweet Spot.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will not sell, exchange, rent, lease or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to other third-party marketers or any such
			persons that are not associated with Canum as an advertiser, sponsor, or promotional partner (collectively &quot;Advertisers&quot;)
			unless it is necessary to 1) conform to regulatory and legal requirements or to comply with legal process, 2) to protect the safety
			and security of our users, employees, or property, 3) to defend the rights of the Site or Canum, or 4) to enforce the
			Terms of Use Agreement.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is necessary that we share your Personal Information with our operational service providers, the specialists that provide internal
			support to our Site design, development, hosting and operations including maintenance, management, storage and/or fulfillment of our
			membership and e-mail clubs, various contests, sweepstakes, services, events and online stores. We use operational service providers to
			efficiently provide the full range of content, activities and membership services we bring to you and we request that our operational
			service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your personal information with third-party marketers that are not associated
			with Canum or this Site.
		</p>
		<p>
			We reserve the right to monitor and edit any Personal Information about our users, including information about the use of website
			activities and services and the contents of users&#8217; email and messages for internal purposes and when necessary, to disclose
			to law enforcement personnel, and/or the employer and/or Internet Service Provider of a user that is not in compliance with the
			Terms of Use Agreement. We will take such measures if we believe it is necessary to protect the security and operations of this Site.
			We provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related website information to reputable third-party vendors
			or marketing companies, but these statistics do not disclose Personal Information about a particular user.

			<strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>
			To enhance your experience with our Site, some of our webpages may use &quot;cookies.&quot; In general, cookies are small text files
			that we place in your computer&#8217;s browser to store your preferences. These cookies do not, by themselves, tell us your e-mail
			address and/or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example,
			registering at our Site. If, however, you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may
			be linked to the data stored in the cookie. In particular, we may use both &quot;session ID cookies&quot; and &quot;persistent cookies.&quot;
			In the case of a session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie terminates altogether. In contrast, a persistent cookie
			may be stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you would like to remove persistent cookies from your hard drive,
			you may do so by following Internet browser help file directions. The reason we use cookies is to understand site usage and to improve
			the content and offerings on our Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Site (e.g., to recognize
			you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our
			Site. In addition, we may also use cookies to offer your products, programs or services.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong>Site Notices</strong><br>
			From time to time, we may email registered Site visitors important information regarding their use of this Site or changes to this Privacy
			Policy or our Terms of Service. You may not opt out of receiving such information.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong>Leaving the Site</strong><br>
			Please note that third parties may collect information about you, through cookies or other technologies, when you link to their websites
			through our Site. You acknowledge that we do not monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of these or any other
			third parties, and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their websites. We encourage you to review the privacy
			policies of such third parties to understand how they collect and use information.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong>Security</strong><br>
			We use reasonable security methods to protect the data that resides on our servers. Yet because no security system is impenetrable, we
			cannot guarantee the security of our servers. It is also possible that information you supply to us will be intercepted during transmission.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong>Exclusions</strong><br>
			This Privacy Policy does not restrict or prohibit our use or disclosure of public information. We reserve the right to disclose any and all
			membership and visitor databases collected by the website, in the event that the assets or stock of Canum, its corporate licensee or parent
			company are sold or transferred to, or merged with a different company or entity, and to contact you at any time regarding the administration
			of the Site, its various activities and your membership.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong><br>
			We reserve the right to revise this policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be
			effective to you as a user of the Site immediately upon posting. Therefore, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy often. Your
			continued use of our Site subsequent to changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept and agree to the changes.
